# BikeShare

BikeShare is part of my CPR E 329 / S E 329 project management class. We were set to come up with a project to work for the semester and face different challenges as a team; thus, learning about project management first-hand.

BikeShare is set to be an application that worked as a bike renting system for the community. An user would be able to create a profile and interact with the program such that they are able to locate a desired available bike near them, unlock it with a QR code, have the application track the userâ€™s trip and provide payment information to finish said trip
